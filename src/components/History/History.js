            A & L Feed resides within Old McKinleyille Store building, which was built in 1897. 
            The building has been a witness to the entire history of McKinleyville. Over the buildingâ€™s 
            extensive history it has served many purposes for the community including: a general store, 
            the community center, dance hall, restaurant, speakeasy, rooms for rent, as well as a second-hand 
            store. A&L Feed was established in January 1975 and has been proudly serving the community ever 
            since.

            As an inhabitant of one of Humboldt County's oldest structures, we strive to keep the 
            nostalgia present in our business dealings. While we carry corporate brands in our inventory, we 
            also carry a sizeable selection of hometown products, made by vendors right here in Humboldt County. 
            We believe that supporting local business is the most important aspect of building a strong, resilient  
            community, both economically and socially.
